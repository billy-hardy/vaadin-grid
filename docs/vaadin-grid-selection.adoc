= Selection

Vaadin Grid allows index based selection of data rows either through UI interaction or using the JavaScript API.
The selection behavior depends on the currently selected selection mode.

== Selection Mode

Vaadin Grid has four separate selection modes.
Defining the selection mode can be done using the `selection-mode` attribute or the `grid.selection.mode` property of the JavaScript API.

* *Single* (`single`) is the default selection mode. It allows only one row to be selected at once.
* *Multi* (`multi`) selection mode reveals an additional checkbox column allowing the user to select multiple rows.
* *All* (`all`) selection mode has each row selected by default allowing the user to deselect individual rows using an additional checkbox column.
* *Disabled* (`disabled`) disables the selection functionality.

The selection mode can also be changed by some operations on the selection API.
Also if the user selects all items in `multi` selection mode, the mode will change to `all`.

To get notified of changes in the selection mode, you can listen to an event named `selection-mode-changed`.

== Selection API

This chapter explains the basic operations available through the selection API.

`grid.selection.select(index)`::
  Selects the row with the given index. If the selection mode is `single`, this operation will remove the previous selection.

`grid.selection.deselect(index)`::
  Deselects the row with the given index.

`grid.selection.selectAll()`::
  Selects all rows and changes the selection mode to `all`.

`grid.selection.clear()`::
  Deselects all selected rows. If the selection mode is `all`, this operation will change the selection mode to `multi`.

== Accessing the Selected Rows

In order to access the selected row indexes, you can call `grid.selection.selected()` method.
The return value is an array of indexes currently selected.

If your grid has a very large set of items combined with the selection mode `all`, you might want to use the `grid.selection.deselected()` method.
This method returns the indexes of rows that are *not* selected.

The total number of selected items is always available through `grid.selection.size` property.
